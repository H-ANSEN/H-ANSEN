## 👨‍💻 Hello!

- Software Engineering Student At Fulton Schools of Engineering 🥣

I love learning about and developing interactive programs, as well as collaborating with others on large projects. I am most proficient in the Java programming language although I am currently studying C++ in my spare time.

## 👷‍♂️ Currently Working On:

- Currently working on a 2D raster based application/game development framework in Java. This project initially started as a tool for implementation of basic raster graphics algorithms but has slowly expanded into a fun little project!
- Currently studying the C++ programming language.
